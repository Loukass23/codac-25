## Code Academy Berlin Community

Code Academy Berlin was a local coding school for beginner and career changers that operated in Berlin from 2020 to 2025. It was founded with the vision of creating a unique, local, and community-driven learning environment.

The academy offered two five-month courses, Data Analytics and Web Development, which were designed to give students the opportunity to follow their own ideas, take ownership of their personal projects, and reach individual milestones.

Originally, the codac platform was intended to replace the academy's learning platform and serve as a collaborative open-source project for students to contribute to.

Following the announcement of the academy's closure in 2025, the app was redesigned. It now serves as a tribute to the academy and its community of developers, as well as a place to showcase and discuss new work and projects.
